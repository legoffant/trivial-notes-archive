Synopsis

```text
The guide to starting your own business

What chance does my business idea have? Am I a business founder with an entrepreneurial mind? What factors lead to success? How do I recognise risks? The new Start-up Journal is a personal workbook and notebook combined that is clearly structured according to topics, featuring useful suggestions, practical templates and helpful techniques. It helps to develop ideas, assess risks better as well as providing ways in which to convince customers and investors. Future entrepreneurs are inspired to plan the next steps, to give their ideas their own personal stamp and to note down their thoughts and visions.

For anyone looking for potential opportunities and not illusions.

The easy-to-understand structure of methods, as well as a graphic design full of detail, make the Start-up Journal an indispensable tool for all budding business entrepreneurs. Together with Tim Jaudszims, author and business angel, LEUCHTTURM1917 developed an analogue journal for business entrepreneurs, which helps to successfully overcome the hurdles involved with setting up a business, keeping an overview in focus.

In 15 steps to your own company.
The Start-up Journal is a guide to setting up your own business. In 15 simple steps, the user is guided through the planning steps for becoming an entrepreneur and setting up a business by means of clearly structured topics with advice, practical templates and helpful methods.
